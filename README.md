Tour Management Application

Project Overview
The Tour Management Application is a web project built to help users explore and manage different travel and tour packages.
It’s designed as part of a Fullstack Web Development learning journey, starting with a solid frontend foundation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is to make travel planning easier and more engaging through an interactive, easy-to-use interface.

What This Version Includes
This is the frontend-only version of the project.
Here’s what’s been implemented so far:

- A clean and responsive navigation bar to switch between pages (Home, Tours, Gallery, About, Contact).
- A detailed Tours page showing multiple destinations with their duration, price in INR, and number of people per package.
- A filter system to sort tours by price or location.
- An interactive booking form that appears when a user selects a tour.
- A beautiful gallery with high-quality travel images.
- A contact form so users can reach out directly from the website.
- A simple, professional design that works well across desktop and mobile screens.

Technologies Used
HTML5 – for structure and layout
CSS3 – for styling and responsive design
JavaScript – for interactivity and dynamic content

Future Plans (Backend Integration)
In the upcoming phases, this project will grow into a fullstack web application.
Here’s what’s planned next:

1. Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)
   Create server-side routes for fetching and managing tours.
   Handle booking and contact form submissions dynamically.

2. Database Integration (MySQL)
   Store and retrieve tour information and booking data.
   Add admin access to add or update tours.

3. React Frontend
   Rebuild the frontend with React for better scalability and faster performance.
   Connect it with backend APIs for real-time data.

4. Extra Features
   User login and registration.
   Payment gateway integration.
   Reviews and ratings for tours.
   Admin dashboard for managing tours and users.
